# Excel VBA MIDI Music Scales Project

This project demonstrates how to play music scales using VBA.

## Setup

Add the MIDI and note class to a VBA project.

The MIDI class encapsulates all the low level Windows MIDI calls.. 

The Note class handles the logic for playing notes

To play musical notes, code should interact with the Note class only.

A demonstration is included that plays the C Major scale.
